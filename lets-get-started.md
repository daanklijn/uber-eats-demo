# Let's get started


## Install VSCode
Install from https://code.visualstudio.com/


## Install npm (if needed)
Check if you have npm installed by running the command below.
```
npm -v
```
If npm is installed, it should return you the version number of your npm installation.

If that doesn't work, you can install npm by going to this [webpage](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager), specifying your OS, and running the given commands.


## Install git (if needed)
Similarly, check if you have git installed by running the command below.
```
git -v
```

If you don't have git installed you can follow the steps for your OS [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).


## Run the Mini UberEats app
You can clone the UberEats React app by running the command below.
```
git clone https://github.com/daanklijn/uber-eats-demo.git
```
If this was succesfull, move into the root directory of the repoistory.
```
cd uber-eats-demo
```

Download and install the project dependencies using npm
```
npm install
```

And run the app using npm
```
npm start
```

The app should now be running at http://localhost:3000!
